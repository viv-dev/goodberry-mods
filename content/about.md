      - title: We love making things
        description: >-
          Through our powers combined, we decided to pull together our love of making to create the ultimate casts/mods for each of our respective passions. And thus Goodberry Mods was formed - to make custom buttons for retro modders, bling for Smash players, and the prettiest of pretty dice to satisfy even the most scrupulous of dice collectors.

      - title: We think quality is paramount
        description: >-
          Our biggest focus is ensuring what we make not only looks good, but **feels** good too. Sure there are plenty of Chinese made versions of our products you can buy for pennies off e-bay or Aliexpress, but we guarantee that when you get our lovingly hand made stuff that they'll feel and look like magic in your hands.
