      All right, friends. Let’s do this! This section will cover basic,
      frequently asked questions for how we operate and what to expect when you order from us.

    questions:
      - question: When do you guys restock?
        answer: >-
          Since we're a home operation and make everything by hand, we have a weekly cycle we work through, releasing a 'drop' of all items we created the week before on Mondays. If you want to make sure you get a change to grab some our cooler stuff, make sure to follow us on twitter and instagram so you get the drop on our drops as soon as possible.
      - question: How long does shipping take?
        answer: >-
          Similar to above, we have a standard shipping cycle where we ship all orders recieved from the week before on Mondays. After we get your stuff shipped you can expect shiping times to take:

            - Between 3 to 5 business days in Australia.
            - Between 5 to 10 business days internationally.
            - Mars shipping will be automatically redirected to Elon Musk’s Twitter account.
      - question: How do refunds and returns work?
        answer: >-
          It happens. Even the most beautiful of plants will disappoint
          *someone*. Again, tell it like it is:

            - All discounted items sales are final.
            - If you’d like another version of your item, please use the return label. Instructions are printed on its back.
            - If your item is damaged or not functioning correctly, email us at info@planty.com, and we’ll refund you + send you a new one ASAP!
      - question: How do you handle sensitive customer information?
        answer: >-

          am I right? Make sure you’re as transparent as possible with your data
          handling process. Or, if you’re using Snipcart, just refer to [our ToS
          and DPA](http://bit.ly/2YJwlyt).
      # - question: Rapid-fire questions
      #   answer: >-
      #     Q: Why is this Planty theme so beautiful? <br /> A: We hired our first
      #     designer a couple of months ago. <br /><br /> Q: Why did you build a
      #     theme for Stackbit? <br /> A: We believe in Stackbit’s promise of
      #     opening up the JAMstack to more developers. Plus, we trust these
      #     folks. [Read more about Stackbit](http://bit.ly/2YAvGix). <br /><br />
      #     Q: How many people work at Snipcart? <br /> A: Not a lot! We’re a
      #     small, bootstrapped team of eight human beings. Michael might be a
      #     robot, though. <br /><br /> Q: Why is Snipcart based in Québec City?
      #     <br /> A: Have you been here? It’s beaaautiful! <br /><br /> Q: What’s
      #     the meaning of life? <br /> A: We’re not quite sure. But building
      #     useful products with people we love feels meaningful enough.
